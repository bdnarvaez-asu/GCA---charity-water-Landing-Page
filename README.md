# GCA---charity-water-Landing-Page
Made for the Global Career Accelerator Program, Spring 2026. Goal: Transforming my Canva mockup into a fully functional landing page using HTML and CSS.

The project: Develop a landing page for charity:water with a target audience of college students who support good causes but don't ecessarily have the means to donate big numbers (i.e., $10).
